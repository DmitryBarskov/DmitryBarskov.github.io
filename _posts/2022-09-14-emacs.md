## Basics

Emacs is a text editor with command line interface. It allows to edit a text
using only keyboard. You can write text on it as usual and perform "shortcuts"
to perform some actions with the editor and the text.

These "shurtcuts" are called commands.

```
    C-x C-c Close the editor.
```
To perform this command you have to press "x" key when CTRL key is hold
and then press "c" key when CTRL key is hold.
In commands first "C-" means CTRL key.
"M-" means Meta key which is usually labeled "alt" or "option".

> NOTE: not all terminals support Meta key.
But it can be emulated by pressing ESC key and then a target key sequentially.
For example for command `M-f` you can press "f" while holding "alt" or you can
type ESC and then press "f".

## Movements

Here is a summary of simple cursor-moving operations,
including the word and sentence moving commands:

```
    C-f     Move forward a character
    C-b     Move backward a character

    M-f     Move forward a word
    M-b     Move backward a word

    C-n     Move to next line
    C-p     Move to previous line

    C-a     Move to beginning of line
    C-e     Move to end of line

    M-a     Move back to beginning of sentence
    M-e     Move forward to end of sentence

    M-<     Move to beginning of whole text
    M->     Move to end of whole text

    C-l     Position line with cursor at the center of screen.
            If it is at the center, position at the top.
            If at the top, position at the bottom.
            If at bottom then position at the center and so on.

    C-u <NUMBER> <CMD>  Perform <CMD> command <NUMBER> times.
                        E. g. C-u 5 C-n will move to next line 5 times.

    M-<NUMBER> <CMD>    Same as above. Type <NUMBER> when holding Meta.
```
