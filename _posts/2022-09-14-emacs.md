## Basics

Emacs is a text editor with command line interface. It allows to edit a text
using only keyboard. You can write text on it as usual and perform "shortcuts"
to perform some actions with the editor and the text.

These "shurtcuts" are called commands.

```
C-x C-c Close the editor.
```
To perform this command you have to press "x" key when CTRL key is hold
and then press "c" key when CTRL key is hold.
In commands first "C-" means CTRL key.
"M-" means Meta key which is usually labeled "alt" or "option".

> NOTE: not all terminals support Meta key.
But it can be emulated by pressing ESC key and then a target key sequentially.
For example for command `M-f` you can press "f" while holding "alt" or you can
type ESC and then press "f".

## Movements

Here is a summary of simple cursor-moving operations,
including the word and sentence moving commands:

```
C-f     Move forward a character
C-b     Move backward a character

M-f     Move forward a word
M-b     Move backward a word

C-n     Move to next line
C-p     Move to previous line

C-a     Move to beginning of line
C-e     Move to end of line

M-a     Move back to beginning of sentence
M-e     Move forward to end of sentence

M-<     Move to beginning of whole text
M->     Move to end of whole text

C-l     Position line with cursor at the center of screen.
        If it is at the center, position at the top.
        If at the top, position at the bottom.
        If at bottom then position at the center and so on.
```

Most of commands be prefixed with `C-u <NUMBER>` for a repeat count.
But `C-v` and `M-v` take it as amount of lines to scroll. E.g. `C-u 10 C-v`
will scroll down 4 lines trying to leave cursor in its place.

```
C-u <NUMBER> <CMD>  Perform <CMD> command <NUMBER> times.
                    E. g. C-u 5 C-n will move to next line 5 times.

M-<NUMBER> <CMD>    Same as above. Type <NUMBER> when holding Meta.
```

You can abort current command by `C-g`. If you change your mind after typing
a part of a command you can abort it by `C-g`. Or you can use it to abort long
running command.

So if you type `C-u 100 C-g C-f` it would move cursor forward by 1 symbol
because you cancelled it with `C-g`.

If you type an unsafe command (`C-x C-l` for example) you see a window
to confirm it. This happened because emacs has "disabled" commands for a noob's
safety. Press `n` to cancel it and `<SPC>` (space) to confirm.

## Windows

`C-x 1` kill all windows other than 1.

## Editing

Just type text :)

You can give repat count to a symbol to insert it many times:

```
M-3 i   produces "iii"
```

Delete text as usual with DEL or Backspace keys. Or...
```
C-d       delete the character under (after for |) the cursor
M-<DEL>   kill the word before the cursor
M-d       kill the word after the cursor
C-k       kill to end of line
M-k       kill to the end of sentence
```
