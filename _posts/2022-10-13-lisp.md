# Lisp

Lisp is a family of programming languages with many dialects in it.

Most popular are Clojure, Common Lisp, Racket.

## Syntax

There are a few special symbols: ` ()'"[]`.

You can write numbers and strings as you usually do in other programming
languages.


```clojure
100500 ; comment about integer
-1.5   ; flating point number
22/7   ; ratio
"ruby" ; string
\e     ; character
#"\d"  ; regex
```

## Symbols

```clojure
def               ; symbol
+                 ; symbol
java.lang.Math/PI ; namespaced symbol
:with             ; keyword
:with/regex       ; keyword with namespace
```

## Literal collections

```clojure
'(1 2 3)     ; list
[1 2 3]      ; vector
#{1 2 3}     ; set
{:a 1, :b 2} ; map
```

### Atoms

Atom is either a literal (numeric or string) of or a symbol.
You can think of a symbol as of name.

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (< n 2)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

### S-expressions

Symbolic expression is an atom or list of other s-exrpressions in braces.

```clojure
(list 3 4 5 (* 3 2) 7) ; s-expression
; list and * are symbols
; 2 3 4 5 7 - numbers 
; (* 3 2) - s-expression
```
