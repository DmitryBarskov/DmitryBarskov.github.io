# Lisp

Lisp is a family of programming languages with many dialects in it.

## Syntax

You can write numbers and strings as you usually do in other programming
languages.

### Atoms

Atom is either a literal (numeric or string) of or a symbol.
You can think of a symbol as of name.

### S-expressions

Symbolic expression is an atom or list of other s-exrpressions in braces.

```lisp
(list 3 4 5 (* 3 2) 7) ; s-expression
; list and * are symbols
; 2 3 4 5 7 - numbers 
; (* 3 2) - s-expression
```
