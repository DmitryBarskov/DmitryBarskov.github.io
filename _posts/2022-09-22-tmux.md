## What is tmux?

tmux is an [open-source](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) terminal multiplexer.

Note: Terminal multiplexer is a tool that allwos you to manage multiple
terminal sessions in a signle window and persist these sessions.

---

## So why should you use it?

- aborting SSH connection won't kill your session
- locally you can manage your tabs and splits without mouse
- store splits and tabs layout

Note: If you are connected through SSH to a server network lag or a power off
due to the laptop bettery runout won't kill your session. And you woubld be
able to continue where you left off.
I found a good use case for me: I can have multiple sessions for work, for blog
writing, for different pet projects with their opened directories and tabs and
panes layout and I don't need to enter them every time I want to to switch my
context. Also it is pretty easy to switch between sessions.

## Terminology

- sessions (terminals)
- windows (tabs)
- panes (splits)

Note: tmux has sessions, windows and panes. You can think of sessions as of
different terminals with persisted tabs and splits layout and its processes.
Windows are just like tabs in these terminals. And panes are splits when you
have two shells side by side on one screen.

## Sessions

In shell:
```sh
tmux new -s work # create a new session named "work"
tmux ls # list sessions
tmux kill-session -t work # kill session named "work"
tmux a -t work # attach to "work"
```

In tmux:
```text
C-b $   Rename current session
C-b d   Detach from session (so you can attach later)
C-w b   Preview sessions and windows. Use C-n and C-p to navigate between
        sessions' windows and ENTER to switch to selected session.
```

C-b x         Close current pane
C-b SPACE     Switch pane layouts
C-b :resize-pane -L <N>   Resize current pane by N cells left
